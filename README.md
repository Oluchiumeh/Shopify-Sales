## Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end business intelligence solution built with Power BI, using Shopify’s e-commerce dataset. The goal was to analyze sales performance, understand customer behavior, evaluate purchase patterns, and highlight business growth opportunities through interactive dashboards and data storytelling.

## Objectives
The project was designed to:

Analyze key metrics such as Net Sales, Order Value, Customer Segments, and Purchase Frequency.

Understand customer lifecycle behavior (single vs repeat customers).

Identify sales trends over time, top-performing products, and geographic hotspots.

Explore payment behavior through various gateway methods.

Provide stakeholders with interactive filters to drill into specific segments like provinces, gateways, and time periods.

## Things to Know (Before Exploring)
This dashboard answers questions like:

How much revenue is the business generating, and from where?

Are customers making repeat purchases or just buying once?

What’s the time value of a customer?

Which payment methods and products generate the most sales?

Which locations drive the most traffic and purchases?

What’s the purchase behavior by time and gateway?

If you're an e-commerce manager, analyst, or executive, this dashboard provides all the insights you need to drive strategy.
